# 🔍 Building Multimodal Search and RAG Systems

This project is based on the [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) short course **"Building Multimodal Search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)"**. It focuses on enhancing large language models (LLMs) with context-aware, multimodal data inputs—extending traditional RAG systems beyond text to incorporate **images, audio, and video**.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand the core principles of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and extend them to **multimodal contexts**.
- Learn how **contrastive learning** is used to train **multimodal embedding models**.
- Build an **any-to-any multimodal search engine**, enabling retrieval of relevant context across text, image, audio, or video.
- Explore **visual instruction tuning** to train LLMs for multimodal reasoning.
- Implement a complete **end-to-end multimodal RAG pipeline** to generate informed, insightful answers based on multimodal context.
- Develop practical applications such as:
  - Visual understanding of **invoices and flowcharts** for structured data extraction.
  - A **multi-vector recommender system** using similarities across modalities (text + image).
- Gain a robust foundation in **multimodal AI**, an essential skillset for next-gen intelligent systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python, PyTorch
- CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)
- OpenAI & Hugging Face APIs
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- LangChain
- Streamlit (for UI)
- LLMs with multimodal capabilities (e.g., BLIP, Flamingo, GPT-4V)

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔗 RAG | Integrating proprietary or external context into LLM prompts |
| 🧠 Contrastive Learning | Aligning multimodal embeddings (text-image pairs) |
| 🔍 Multimodal Search | Cross-modal retrieval (text ↔ image, etc.) |
| 🧾 Visual Instruction Tuning | Training LLMs to follow image-based prompts |
| 💡 Multimodal Reasoning | Answering questions with mixed data modalities |
| 🎯 Industry Use Cases | Invoices, flowcharts, and intelligent recommendations |

## 🚀 Final Project Deliverable

An end-to-end **Multimodal RAG system** that:
- Embeds and indexes different data modalities.
- Retrieves the most relevant multimodal context.
- Generates natural language answers with LLMs.

Includes advanced features like:
- Image-to-text Q&A
- Multimodal similarity-based recommendations
- Structured output extraction from complex visual documents

## 🌟 Why This Matters

As AI systems evolve, they increasingly need to **reason across different modalities**. Whether you're building smarter assistants, document processors, or content discovery engines, **multimodal AI** is becoming indispensable. This project equips you with the foundation to build the next generation of **context-aware, intelligent systems**.
